# Reinforcement Learning 

## An Introduction

Second edition

by *Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto*

These are python scripts I've written to implement exercises or examples in the
book, either standalong or using Gymnasium

This is a work in progress, the requirements are correct but are not pinned. I have to use
python3.11 to run this. Something is wrong with python3.12 and swig or 
gymnasium[box2d] and I can't figure out why at the moment.
