# Reinforcement Learning 

## An Introduction

Second edition

by *Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto*

These are python scripts I've written to implement exercises or examples in the
book, either standalone or using Gymnasium.

This is a work in progress. The requirements.txt are correct, but I have to use
python3.11 to run my scripts. Something is wrong with python3.12 and swig or 
gymnasium[box2d] and I can't figure out why at the moment.

## Installation

For now, simply run:

1. `python3 -m venv venv` unless you like to manage your virtual environments
in a different way. Note that in the gitignore `venv` is ignored.
2. `source venv/bin/activate`
3. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
